# Aims of this Page 

As your peers and fellow students at Smith College, we wanted to offer an easy tool to access resources to educate yourself and others about racism, racial biases, and the oppression of the Black community. The main focus of this site is to provide STEM-focused recources, but we will include any content that amplifies the voices of the Black community. 

# Available Resources

This page contains resources in the context of reading (through books available for purchase and online articles/blogs), video content, and organizations that can be supported via petition signing, social media amplification, and donations. We hope you can find a particular resource medium that best fits your learning needs here. 

# Content Support and Suggestions 

Most importantly, we offer a content submission page where either a new medium can be suggested for content submission, or individual pieces of content can be submitted. This page serves as a potential baseline for all of our education on these topics, so we strongly encourage the submission of other resources to enhance this experience. 

Additionally, if you believe that a topic has not been presented in the best manner on this site, please let us know immediately, as it is easy to make changes and updates to ensure the content shared here is authentic. 

### _We hope you bookmark, share, and reference this site often._
