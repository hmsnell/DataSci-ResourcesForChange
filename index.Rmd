# About This Site: A Note From Its Creators

$~$

Racism and bias exist everywhere, though it is not always obvious at first glance. 

This is particularly true in the field of data science. Due to their mathematical nature, data and algorithms are often treated as objective and unbiased when--in many cases--they are not. It can be easy to put trust in them; many people blindly support algorithms with little consideration of how they were created and how they operate in society. 

In order to be thoughtful, effective, and inclusive data scientists, we believe it is important to understand the ways in which bias can play a dangerous role within our field, to understand the ways in which data can be used to either reinforce/exacerbate or fight oppression, and to support the inclusion of voices of color within the community. 

This site is meant to serve as a resource for Smithies of all backgrounds who are interested in pursuing a future in statistical data sciences. Here, you can find a variety of different materials, from books and articles to videos, podcasts, and organizations to support, on the following topics revolving around data and race:

1) Algorithmic bias

2) Data in the criminal justice system

3) Diversity within the data science community


For those who are just beginning to dip their toes into these ideas, we hope that this site will provide a starting point to your educational journey, encouraging you to seek out further information and think about these ideas more in the future. For those who live these struggles every day, we hope that you can find something here you have not read or seen before, but also that you can find value through sharing these resources with others. 

As young, white students with next to no personal experience in this area, we do not want our voices to drown out those of others who may have valuable perspectives. We have attempted to promote content and organizations created by a diverse group of voices, but also acknowledge that our knowledge on the topic is limited. As such, we believe it is important for this educational process to be interactive. To promote this goal, we have create a content submission form where you can suggest additional resources that you think would be meaningful to share with your peers.

Additionally, we understand that our experiences may affect the way we choose to present information, perhaps resulting in an unbalanced perspective. If you have any suggestions for how to improve the way any of our content is shared, please let us know immediately, as it is easy to make changes and updates to ensure the content shared here is authentic.
