# About This Page

Racism and bias exist everywhere, though it is not always obvious at first glance. As your peers in Smith College Statistical and Data Sciences, we thought it would be valuable to share resources with you all that focus specifically on education around how these problems operate within--and sometimes are exacerbated by--the data science community.

# Available Resources

In order to promote education and change within the data science community, we have provided a variety of different resources focused primarily on the concepts of: 

1) Algorithmic bias

2) Data in the criminal justice system

3) Diversity within the data science community

On this page, you can find readings (both books and articles of varying levels of technicality), video content, and a list of organizations working to promote change on these issues. We hope you can find a particular resource medium that best fits your learning needs here.
